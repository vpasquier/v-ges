Google engine switch is just a tool to quickly switch between search engines in Chrome browser by a simple shortcut.

All the engine switch extensions for Chrome are using a page for handling the engine setup. The goal is to avoid that by having only a shortcut between two search engine to be able to:

- Searching for professional things in Google
- Searching for private things in another search engine (with no tracking for instance)
